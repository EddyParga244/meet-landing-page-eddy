## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I managed to make a landing page for a website using Flexbox and Grid while being guided by the Figma design document, which allowed me to write exact properties in paddings, font sizes, font weights and more.

### Continued development

I plan to continue using the Figma design documents as guides along with the provided preview images so my projects can be more accurate.
